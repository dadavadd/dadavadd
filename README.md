## Beginner C# developer with 2 years of non-commercial experience.

I am a beginner programmer, I have completed courses in C# and .NET. I know the basics of OOP and design patterns, worked with ASP.NET Core and databases (Postgre SQL, Entity Framework). I made simple web applications using REST API and JSON. I also have experience in creating desktop applications on WPF with MVVM. I am familiar with the principles of SOLID and try to apply them. I use Git for version control. I want to develop further and gain experience in real projects!

I also like to code using a low level and using WINAPI.

## My skills include:
- Working with high-level database abstraction (ORM).
- Working with ASP .NET Core Web API.
- Working with IL code using libraries (Mono.Cecil, dnlib).
- Working with unsafe code in C#. Understanding pointers, references, manual allocation and memory cleanup, etc.
- Working with Winforms, WPF, and little C++/CLI.
